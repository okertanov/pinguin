.TH "GPIO" "14 June 2012" "Command-Line access to Raspberry Pi GPIO"

.SH NAME
gpio \- Command-line access to Raspberry Pi GPIO

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gpio
.RB [ \-g ]
.RB < read/write/pwm/mode ...>

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B GPIO
is a command line tool to allow the user easy access to the GPIO pins
on the Raspberry Pi. It's designed for simple testing and diagnostic
purposes, but can be used in shell scripts for general if somewhat slow
control of the GPIO pins.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-g
Use the BCM_GPIO pins numbers rather than WiringPi pin numbers.

.TP
.B read
Read the digital value of the given pin and print 0 or 1 to represent the
respective logic levels.

.TP
.B write
Write the given value (0 or 1) to the pin.

.TP
.B pwm
Write a PWM value (0-1023) to the given pin.

.TP
.B mode
Set a pin into input, output or pwm mode. Can also use the literals up, down or tri
to set the internal pull-up, pull-down or tristate controls.

.SH FILES

.TP 2.2i
.I gpio
executable

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP 2.2i
gpio mode 4 output # Set pin 4 to output
.PP
gpio -g mode 23 output # Set GPIO pin 23 to output (same as WiringPi pin 4)
.PP
gpio mode 1 pwm # Set pin 1 to PWM mode
.PP
gpio pwm 1 512 # Set pin 1 to PWM value 512 - half brightness
